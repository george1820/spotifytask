# spotifytask
This repo contains data and code for a task to conduct a short EDA on a Spotify dataset.

Meanings of column names/features can be found on the Spotify API website.

Task was to 'Summarise the taste in music' of the songs included within the dataset. I took the approach of analysing how recent the songs in the dataset are, and then looking at how this is reflected in the distribution of different audio feature variables provided by Spotify API. Finally, I clustered the songs via K-means into 3 clusters, and based on the analysis of the audio features of these clusters, defined them as being seperated into 'Electronic Dance Songs', 'Chilled Focus Songs' and 'Upbeat Singalong Classics'.
